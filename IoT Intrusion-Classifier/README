IoT Intrusion Detection Using Deep Learning
A 1D Convolutional Neural Network implementation for detecting network intrusions in IoT environments, with emphasis on handling severe class imbalance and computational efficiency.
🎯 Project Overview
This project addresses the critical challenge of detecting rare cyberattacks in IoT networks where class imbalance severely impacts detection rates. Traditional models often achieve high overall accuracy while completely missing minority attack classes—a critical failure in cybersecurity applications.
Key Achievement: Improved recall for minority attack classes from 0% to 43% by strategically trading 10% overall accuracy for significantly better rare attack detection.

Design Principles:

Minimal layers for computational efficiency
Small kernel sizes (5, 3, 3) to reduce parameters
Strategic padding to maintain spatial consistency
Suitable for edge device deployment

🔬 Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing

Missing Value Handling: Mean imputation to preserve behavioral patterns
Feature Analysis: Frequency analysis and feature importance calculation
Normalization: Standard scaling for consistent feature ranges
Protocol Handling: Specialized processing for network protocol columns

2. Class Imbalance Solution

Problem: Rare attacks had 0% detection rate initially
Solution: Class-weighted cross-entropy loss with weights computed from inverse class frequencies
Impact: Eliminated zero-recall behavior for minority classes

3. Hyperparameter Optimization Journey
Initial Approach: Genetic Algorithms

Explored evolutionary optimization
Switched due to computational efficiency concerns

Final Approach: Bayesian Optimization

More efficient hyperparameter search
Guided by F1/Precision/Recall heatmaps
Iterative refinement based on minority class performance

Optimized Hyperparameters:

Learning Rate: 0.0001 (Adam optimizer)
Batch Size: 4096 (optimized for 32GB RAM)
Epochs: 50
Scheduler: ReduceLROnPlateau
Loss Function: Class-weighted Cross-Entropy

The Strategic Trade-off
Decision: Sacrificed 10% overall accuracy to achieve 62% recall
Rationale: In cybersecurity applications, missing a rare attack (false negative) is far more costly than a false alarm (false positive). This model prioritizes detection capability over raw accuracy.
